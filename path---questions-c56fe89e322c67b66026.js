I never have been\nI've greatly enjoyed being part of this community with you and building this thing together and have always respected you and considered you a friend..</p>\n<p>Not gonna lie..\nThe next half hour or so... It's gonna push a bit</p>\n<p>I'm gonna touch on things that are none of mine or anyone else's business ...  that might be private info, .....shit you don't want to answer  - either to protect yourself, the business, others, and CWNs public persona; but I believe --- in this instance, complete transparency is the only approach... And tbh - I personally won't settle for less. I don't think the rest of the community should either..  CWN is behind the 8 ball. Right now CWN either scratches and walks away tail between its legs or it gets a rematch. Likely the former...  </p>\n<p>Also - just FYI... starting a few weeks ago, scroatum time is not free.... The terms are very open, but I'm actually done giving for nothing... I've alienated so fucking many in just trying to quell the shit that exists between the few and it's pissing me off.  </p>\n<p>It may look like I'm just here to make people laugh... lighten the mood and distract  - and while thats definitely definitely true a lot of the time, there is also a calculated method to the madness.  I spend several hours a day talking to everyone to try and keep the peace andI take this very seriously.  I don't have the luxury of a canned response to the community.  When someone who subscribes asks me questions, I spend the time to make sure they are still here next month. </p>\n<p>With all of that in mind.. </p>\n<h2>I want to know ...</h2>\n<h3>Why was Backtrack banned?</h3>\n<p>\"Since you lost the use of your testicles in the army last year, do you feel it has turned you into a power hungry monster? Did that affect your decision on what you did to Rick's and CWN's community?\" - single </p>\n<h3>What's with all the secrecy?</h3>\n<p>Why have you been so closely guarded everything?\nUp until now, there's been absolutely nothing shared with the community or the 'admin/OG' group.... and while that is <em>completely</em> within your right, I feel , especially in this case, that absolute transparency is imperitive. </p>\n<p>To my understanding, the lions share of the control has laid in your hands - which has directly related to things being done or not done for months...<br>\nYou must have seen how CWN could have benefitted, in the short and long term, with sharing the say, being cooperative, and letting others that may have had more experience take the reigns for the betterment of the business and helped move things forward....\nAt some point you must have seen that... When?<br>\nWhy no action on it?</p>\n<h3>Why is backtrack banned?</h3>\n<p>Why was nobody else given the ability to make change if you weren't going to create teams, assign leaders, and make sure shit got done?\nWhy were not methods implimented ages ago to share the wealth with everyone?  Example: bitmex ref on Nightbot... 3 months ago....\nWhere is the money?\nAll the money....\nHow much do yiou have and how much do they have?\nWhy difference?\nHave you done more? Or were you just the lucky one that Rick picked to do the discord, and enterprisingly, you registered everthing in your name.... </p>\n<h3>Why is Backtrack banned?</h3>\n<p>What do you have control of/say of vs what Single/oven/Jr do and why would you not give up any control?\nWhat did and didn't you have access to, and what did you block access to, and why?</p>\n<h3>Who's got the bitmex Ref account?</h3>\n<p>Was there room for negotiation in Mike's contract?  ... regardless of pre-emptive preparations...\nIf you'd spoken to the other owners, or even any of the mod team, do you think it could have gone differently?</p>\n<h3>Why was backtrack banned</h3>\n<p>Do you recall the conversation you had with Chak after my R+ interview?\nWhen I left my Respected Plus interview... there was a conversation between you and Chak... Could you sum that up?\nWas there any discussion of using me to produce revenue for CWN while I 'control the horde' for free?\nAnd what happened after?\nWhy?</p>\n<h3>Why was Backtrack banned?  In case I forgot to ask..</h3>\n<p>Who's getting what share of the Twitch revenue when it comes up shortly?</p>\n<p>How is the CWN pot being split?  </p>\n<p>How much was in the pot?</p>\n<p>All of the donation wallets since CWN's inception?  All of the original wallets from Day 1 to now...  May we explore their activity and is there legitimate onpaper explanations for each transation?</p>\n<p>If we looked at every wallet address that's been in the CWN discord or Stream.. back to January; would every transaction to and from those wallets be able to be accounted for?  </p>\n<p>Why?  Why Not?</p>\n<h3>Why was mattertea banned?</h3>\n<p>Is there reconcillliation?/....  Why, Why not? - - - -  - - -\nThere's room for 2, but not for 3.... So how, if at all, do you and the other owners regroup?\nWe can all see CN's Twitch #'s....  Not stellar... Is it better for you to re-brand and try to build from the ground up?  Below ground really...  </p>\n<p>If it's not... then clearly one will likely sink\nand I bet its not the one that I've invited over 500 people to..</p>\n<p>Then why was backtrack banned?  Annnd mattertea?</p>\n<h3>Sooooo which will it be??</h3>\n<p>Do you think that you can alone create a product with more appeal than the current offering?  OR any appeal?<br>\nSomething that serves to bring this community closer together rather than pushing apart? </p>\n<h3>No...  So...  now what?</h3>\n<p>Yes?  How?\nIf yes, how were arrangements made for talent?  What has been offered, promised, or pre-paid for services?\nWhere did those funds come from? </p>\n<p>Is there anything you can say to the other owners that would...  make them see that you get it?\nThat the mistakes made are not irreversible and that it's in this community's best interest for everyone to figure their shit out and get it together??\nI guarantee you one thing... there's a huuuuuge amount of humility involved... and not a lot of \"But I was right\"... </p>\n<p>IS that ok? </p>\n<p>If it's not, well...</p>\n<p>If it is.... What will you concede on, sacrifice, and negotiate with to keep this whole thing moving?  What needs to happen in order for You and CN to get along?\nCan it go back to one unit (whihc basically involves, for all intents and purposes, your role being drastically reduced to that of a silent shareholder with an equal vote)</p>\n<h3>Why is backtrack banned?</h3>\n<p>Part 2: only half marks... </p>\n<h3>why is mattertea banned?</h3>\n<p>Would you say that the way you've handled things, partly, up till now, may have been as much of a hindrance as a help?\nWould it be accurate to say that many issues that have arisen as we've grown, but defintely over the past few weeks, would mainly lie on your shoulders if only because of your own indecision...  And thts not a bad thing - but - being able to admit to yourself that you needed help was maybe... probably... a problem all along?</p>\n<p>Would you agree that the only way CWN continues to thrive as a valid profitable business is ... having the core back and each having an <em>equal</em> say in every decision ... but... maybe; and absolutely no insult to you - but simply an internal acknowledgement that the scope of this may be beyond your <em>current</em> capabilies... and that those decisions may be more beneficial to the business on the whole with you moving to a silent role with an equal, yet not governing say in those decisions- as stated in the following announcement that was neer released.... (screenshot)\n</p>\n<p>What have you learned from this?</p>\n<p>PS: why'd you ban backtrack</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Dear Smelliot",date:"June 01, 2018"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
